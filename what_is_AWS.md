Cloud computing is on-demand delivery via Internet of various IT resources. They do the complex heavy lifting and setting up the infrastructure, so you don’t have to build everything from ground up.
  
  Amazon Web Services is the biggest cloud computing provider, dominating the market for the past 10 years, currently having ~>30% of the market. Top competitors are MS Azure having ~20% and Google Cloud having ~<10%. Notable others are Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, VMware Cloud, Dell Cloud.
  
  Learning AWS is a steep learning curve: gaining practical knowledge takes a few weeks and in a month or two you could expect to be undertaking professional work using AWS. Knowing one cloud computing platform makes transitioning to another one easier and of course you can know several of them simultaneously.
  
  One can try to get AWS certified. Exam costs scale up along with required knowledge to pass the exams. They are $100/$150/$300 per exam. Passing an exam will grant you a certificate.
  
  AWS is constantly adding new features and services, competing for their share of 300 billion USD cloud computing market. The market is expected to grow annually by 19% until 2028.  
  List of services that AWS provides:
compute – storage – database – blockchain -- customer engagement – satellite –analytics -- business apps – management -- security/identity — streaming – IoT –migration -- media services -- game development -- networking-developer tools --machine learning -- AR & VR -- cost management.
  
  Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy to use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with PHP, Node, Python, Java… and more.
  
  With it, you simply upload your code and the Beanstalk automatically handles deployment, auto scaling, capacity provisioning and load balancing.
  
  You can set up AWS CodePipeline so that whenever you commit changes to a set GitHub repository, your online Elastic Beanstalk web-app will update in ~minutes, having latest code from that repository.
  
  //CodeDeploy

  AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to Amazon EC2 instances. 
AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. You can use AWS CodeDeploy to automate deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one EC2 instance or thousands.

  This service efficiently deploys your released code to a “fleet” of EC2 instances while taking care to leave as much of the fleet online as possible. It can accommodate fleets that range in size from one instance all the way up to tens of thousands of instance.

  Benefits :
  
  Automated Deployments,
  Minimize Downtime,
  Centralized Control,
  Easy To Adopt
