Cloud computing is on-demand delivery via Internet of various IT resources. They do the complex heavy lifting and setting up the infrastructure, so you don’t have to build everything from ground up.

Top competitors are MS Azure having ~20% and Google Cloud having ~<10%. Notable others are Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, VMware Cloud, Dell Cloud.
  
  Learning AWS is a steep learning curve: gaining practical knowledge takes a few weeks and in a month or two you could expect to be undertaking professional work using AWS.
